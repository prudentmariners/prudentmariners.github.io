                  Prudent Mariners was founded in 2018 as a general mobile marine services company by Claude Nix with the goal of providing prompt and reliable service and support to the transient and cruising boaters transiting the Mile Zero area of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. Since this time, the company has served thousands of customers and earned a reputation for quality, reliability and excellent support.
